## Installation

To install the PyConstClasses package in your python environment run:
```shell
pip install pyconstclasses
```
or
```shell
python -m pip install pyconstclasses
```

<br />
<br />

## Tutorial

After installing the package, you have to import it to your python program:
```python
import constclasses as cc
```

### Basic usage

The core of the PyConstClasses package are the `const_class` and `static_const_class` decorators. Both of these decorators override the default behaviour of the `__setattr__` magic method for the decorated class so that it thors `cc.ConstError` when trying to modify the constant attribute of an instance.

* The `const_class` decorator allows you to define a class structure and create constant instances of the defined class:

    ```python
    # const_class_basic.py

    @cc.const_class
    class Person:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        john = Person("John", "Doe")
        print(f"{john = }")

        try:
            john.first_name = "Bob"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        try:
            john.last_name = "Smith"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")
    ```

    This program will produce the following output:
    ```
    john = John Doe
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `first_name` of class `Person`
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `last_name` of class `Person`
    ```

* The `static_const_class` deacorator allows you to define a pseudo-static resource with const members (it creates an instance of the decorated class):

    ```python
    # static_const_class_basic.py

    @cc.static_const_class
    class ProjectConfiguration:
        name: str = "MyProject"
        version: str = "alpha"

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"Project: {self.name}\nVersion: {self.version}"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(f"Project configuration:\n{ProjectConfiguration}")

        try:
            ProjectConfiguration.name = "NewProjectName"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        try:
            ProjectConfiguration.version = "beta"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")
    ```

    This program will produce the following output:
    ```
    Project configuration:
    Project: MyProject
    Version: alpha
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `name` of class `ProjectConfiguration`
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `version` of class `ProjectConfiguration`
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the current version of the package the constant attributes have to be defined using annotations, i.e. the `member: type (= value)` syntax of the class member declaration is required

<br />

### Common parameters

Both const decorators - `const_class` and `static_const_class` - have the following parameters:

* `with_strict_types: bool`

    If this parameter's value is set to
    * `False` - the decorators will use the `attribute_type(given_value)` conversion, so as long as the given value's type is convertible to the desired type, the decorators will not raise any errors.
    * `True` - the decorators will perform an `isinstance(given_value, attribute_type)` check, the failure of which will result in raising a `TypeError`

    Example:
    ```python
    # common_with_strict_types.py

    @cc.const_class
    class Person:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        age: int

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} [age: {self.age}]"

    @cc.const_class(with_strict_types=True)
    class PersonStrictTypes:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        age: int

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} [age: {self.age}]"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        john = Person("John", "Doe", 21.5)
        print(john)

        try:
            # invalid as 21.5 is not an instance of int
            john_strict = PersonStrictTypes("John", "Doe", 21.5)
        except TypeError as err:
            print(f"Error:\n{err}")

        john_strict = PersonStrictTypes("John", "Doe", 21)
        print(john_strict)
    ```

    This program will produce the following output:
    ```
    John Doe [age: 21]
    Error:
    Attribute value does not match the declared type:
            attribute: age, declared type: <class 'int'>, actual type: <class 'float'>
    John Doe [age: 21]
    ```

* `include: set[str]`

    This parameter defines a set of attribute names which are supposed to be treated as constant. If the parameter is not set (or set to `None`) all attributes will be treaded as constant.

    Example:
    ```python
    # common_include.py

    @cc.const_class(include=["first_name", "last_name"])
    class Person:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        age: int

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} [age: {self.age}]"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        john = Person("John", "Doe", 21)
        print(f"{john = }")

        try:
            john.first_name = "Bob"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        try:
            john.last_name = "Smith"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        # valid modification as the `age` parameter is not in the include set
        john.age = 22
        print(f"{john = }")
    ```

    This program will produce the followig output:
    ```
    john = John Doe [age: 21]
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `first_name` of class `Person`
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `last_name` of class `Person`
    john = John Doe [age: 22]
    ```

* `exclude: set[str]`

    This parameter defines a set of attribute names which are supposed to be treated as mutable. If the parameter is not set (or set to `None`) all attributes will be treaded as constant.

    Example:
    ```python
    # common_exclude.py

    @cc.const_class(exclude=["age"])
    class Person:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        age: int

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} [age: {self.age}]"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        john = Person("John", "Doe", 21)
        print(f"{john = }")

        try:
            john.first_name = "Bob"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        try:
            john.last_name = "Smith"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        # valid modification as the `age` parameter is in the exclude set
        john.age = 22
        print(f"{john = }")
    ```

    The class defined in this example has the behaviour equivalent to the `include` example.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Simultaneous usage of the `incldue` and `exclude` parameters will result in raising a configuration error.

<br />

### Decorator-specific parameters

> [!NOTE]
> In the current version of the package only the `const_class` decorator has it's own specific parameters.

* `with_kwargs: bool`

    By default the `const_class` decorator adds a constructor which uses positional arguments to create a constant instance of the class. However if this parameter is set to `True`, the decorator will use the keyword arguments for this purpose.

    Example:
    ```python
    # const_class_with_kwargs.py

    @cc.const_class
    class PersonArgs:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"


    @cc.const_class(with_kwargs=True)
    class PersonKwargs:
        first_name: str
        last_name: str

        def __repr__(self) -> str:
            return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        john_args = PersonArgs("John", "Doe")
        print(f"{john_args = }")

        try:
            john_args = PersonArgs(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
        except cc.InitializationError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        john_kwargs = PersonKwargs(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
        print(f"{john_kwargs = }")
    ```

    This program will produce the following output:
    ```
    john_args = John Doe
    Error: Invalid number of arguments: expected 2 - got 0
    john_kwargs = John Doe
    ```

* `inherit_constructor: bool`

    By default the `const_class` decorator defines a constructor which manually assigns values to attributes. However if this parameter is set to `True` the class will be initialized using the user defined `__init__` function of the decorated class.

    Example:
    ```python
    # const_class_inherit_constructor.py

    @cc.static_const_class
    class ProjectConfiguration:
        name: str = "MyProject"
        version: str = "alpha"

        def __repr__(self):
            return f"Project: {self.name}\nVersion: {self.version}"


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(f"Project configuration:\n{ProjectConfiguration}")

        try:
            ProjectConfiguration.name = "NewProjectName"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")

        try:
            ProjectConfiguration.version = "beta"
        except cc.ConstError as err:
            print(f"Error: {err}")
    ```

    This program will produce the following output:
    ```
    john = John Doe
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `first_name` of class `Person`
    Error: Cannot modify const attribute `last_name` of class `Person`
    ```

## Examples

The project examples (including the ones displayed in the [Tutorial](#tutorial) section) can be found in the `examples` directory.

To run the example programs you need to install the PyConstClasses package into your python environment. You can install it via `pip` of using a local distribution build (the process is described in the [Dev notes](#dev-notes) section).

<br />
<br />

## Dev notes

### Environment setup:

To be able to build or test the project create a python virtual environment

```shell
python -m venv cc_venv
source cc_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> If any package listed in `requirements-dev.txt` is no longer required or if there is a new required package, update the requirements file using: `pip freeze > requirements-dev.txt`

### Building

To build the package, run:
```shell
python -m build
```

This will generate the `dist` directory with the `.whl` file. To locally test if the distribution is correct, you can run:
```shell
pip install dist/pyconstclasses-<version>-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall
```

> [!NOTE]
> To test the package build locally it is recommended to use a sepparate virtual environment.

### Uploading

To upload the package to [pypi](https://pypi.org/) do the following:

* Make sure that the `twine` package is installed in your python environment: `pip show twine`
* Upload the package to the testpypi repository:
    ```shell
    python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
    ```
* Verify wether the package has been succesfully uploaded by installing it to your python (virtual) environment:
    ```shell
    python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps pyconstclasses
    ```
* Verify the installation by running the example programs
* If no problem occured, upload the package to [pypi](https://pypi.org/):
    ```shell
    twine upload dist/*
    ```
* Verify wether the package has been succesfully uploaded by installing it to your python (virtual) environment:
    ```shell
    python -m pip install pyconstclasses
    ```
* Verify the installation by running the example programs


### Testing:

The project uses `pytest` and `tox` for testing purposes.
* To run the tests for the current python interpreter run: `pytest -v`
* To run tests for all supported python versions run: `tox`

### Coverage

To generate a test coverage report you can run `tox` which will automatically generate `json` and `xml` reports (the types of coverage reports can be adjusted in `tox.ini`).

You can also generate the coverage reports manually with `pytest`, e.g.:
```shell
pytest -v --cov=constclasses --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html
```

> [!NOTE]
> When testing the project or generating coverate reports, python (or it's packages) will generate additional files (cache file, etc.). To easily clean those files from the working directory run `bash scripts/cleanup.sh`

### Formatting:

The project uses `black` and `isort` for formatting purposes. To format the source code use the prepared script:
```shell
bash scripts/format.sh
```
You can also use the `black` and `isort` packages directly, e.g.:
```shell
python -m <black/isort> <path> (--check)
```

<br />
